<a name="manual-intro.overview"></a>1.1. An Overview of Valgrind</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Valgrind is a suite of simulation-based debugging and
profiling tools for programs running on Linux (x86, amd64 and ppc32).
The system consists of a core, which
provides a synthetic CPU in software, and a series of tools,
each of which performs some kind of debugging, profiling, or
similar task.  The architecture is modular, so that new tools can
be created easily and without disturbing the existing
structure.</p>
<p>A number of useful tools are supplied as standard.  In
summary, these are:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Memcheck</strong></span> detects memory-management
    problems in your programs.  All reads and writes of memory
    are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
    intercepted. As a result, Memcheck can detect the following
    problems:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Use of uninitialised memory</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing memory after it has been
      free'd</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd
      blocks</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the
      stack</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd
      blocks are lost forever</p></li>
<li><p>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs
      free/delete/delete []</p></li>
<li><p>Overlapping <code class="computeroutput">src</code> and
      <code class="computeroutput">dst</code> pointers in
      <code class="computeroutput">memcpy()</code> and related
      functions</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Problems like these can be difficult to find by other
    means, often lying undetected for long periods, then causing
    occasional, difficult-to-diagnose crashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Addrcheck</strong></span> is a lightweight version
    of Memcheck.  It is identical to Memcheck except for the
    single detail that it does not do any uninitialised-value
    checks.  All of the other checks -- primarily the
    fine-grained address checking -- are still done.  The
    downside of this is that you don't catch the
    uninitialised-value errors that Memcheck can find.</p>
<p>But the upside is significant: programs run about twice
    as fast as they do on Memcheck, and a lot less memory is
    used.  It still finds reads/writes of freed memory, memory
    off the end of blocks and in other invalid places, bugs which
    you really want to find before release!</p>
<p>Because Addrcheck is lighter and faster than Memcheck,
    you can run more programs for longer, and so you may be able
    to cover more test scenarios.  Addrcheck was created because
    one of us (Julian) wanted to be able to run a complete KDE
    desktop session with checking.  As of early November 2002, we
    have been able to run KDE-3.0.3 on a 1.7 GHz P4 with 512 MB
    of memory, using Addrcheck.  Although the result is not
    stellar, it's quite usable, and it seems plausible to run KDE
    for long periods at a time like this, collecting up all the
    addressing errors that appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: Addrcheck is not available in Valgrind 3.1.X.  We hope
    to reinstate its functionality in later releases.  For now, use 
    Memcheck instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Cachegrind</strong></span> is a cache profiler.  It
    performs detailed simulation of the I1, D1 and L2 caches in
    your CPU and so can accurately pinpoint the sources of cache
    misses in your code.  If you desire, it will show the number
    of cache misses, memory references and instructions accruing
    to each line of source code, with per-function, per-module
    and whole-program summaries.  If you ask really nicely it
    will even show counts for each individual machine
    instruction.</p>
<p>On x86 and AMD64, Cachegrind auto-detects your machine's cache
    configuration using the
    <code class="computeroutput">CPUID</code> instruction, and so
    needs no further configuration info, in most cases.</p>
<p>Cachegrind is nicely complemented by Josef
    Weidendorfer's amazing KCacheGrind visualisation tool 
    (<a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net" target="_top">http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net</a>),
    a KDE application which presents these profiling results in a
    graphical and easier-to-understand form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Helgrind</strong></span> finds data races in
    multithreaded programs.  Helgrind looks for memory locations
    which are accessed by more than one (POSIX p-)thread, but for
    which no consistently used (pthread_mutex_)lock can be found.
    Such locations are indicative of missing synchronisation
    between threads, and could cause hard-to-find
    timing-dependent problems.</p>
<p>Helgrind ("Hell's Gate", in Norse mythology) implements
    the so-called "Eraser" data-race-detection algorithm, along
    with various refinements (thread-segment lifetimes) which
    reduce the number of false errors it reports.  It is as yet
    somewhat of an experimental tool, so your feedback is
    especially welcomed here.</p>
<p>Helgrind has been hacked on extensively by Jeremy
    Fitzhardinge, and we have him to thank for getting it to a
    releasable state.</p>
<p>NOTE: Helgrind is, unfortunately, not available in Valgrind 3.1.X,
    as a result of threading changes that happened in the 2.4.0 release.
    We hope to reinstate its functionality in a future 3.2.0 release.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>A couple of minor tools (<span><strong class="command">Lackey</strong></span> 
and <span><strong class="command">Nulgrind</strong></span>) are
also supplied.  These aren't particularly useful -- they exist to
illustrate how to create simple tools and to help the valgrind
developers in various ways.  Nulgrind is the null tool -- it adds 
no instrumentation.  Lackey is a simple example tool 
which counts instructions, memory accesses, and the number of
integer and floating point operations your program does.</p>
<p>Valgrind is closely tied to details of the CPU and operating
system, and to a lesser extent, the compiler and basic C libraries.
Nonetheless, as of version 3.1.0 it supports several platforms: x86/Linux
(mature), AMD64/Linux (maturing), and PPC32/Linux (immature but works well).
Valgrind uses the standard Unix
<code class="computeroutput">./configure</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">make</code>, <code class="computeroutput">make
install</code> mechanism, and we have attempted to
ensure that it works on machines with kernel 2.4 or 2.6 and glibc
2.2.X--2.3.X.</p>
<p>Valgrind is licensed under the <a href="license.gpl.html"> The GNU General Public License</a>,
version 2.  The <code class="computeroutput">valgrind/*.h</code> headers that
you may wish to include in your code (eg.
<code class="computeroutput">valgrind.h</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">memcheck.h</code>) are
distributed under a BSD-style license, so you may include them in your code
without worrying about license conflicts.  Some of the PThreads test cases,
<code class="computeroutput">pth_*.c</code>, are taken from

<p>The Valgrind distribution consists of the Valgrind core,
upon which are built Valgrind tools, which do different kinds of
debugging and profiling.  This manual is structured
similarly.</p>
<p>First, we describe the Valgrind core, how to use it, and
the flags it supports.  Then, each tool has its own chapter in
this manual.  You only need to read the documentation for the
core and for the tool(s) you actually use, although you may find
it helpful to be at least a little bit familar with what all
tools do.  If you're new to all this, you probably want to run
the Memcheck tool.  If you want to write a new tool, read 
<a href="writing-tools.html">Writing a New Valgrind Tool</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that the core understands some command line flags,
and the tools have their own flags which they know about.  This
means there is no central place describing all the flags that are
accepted -- you have to read the flags documentation both for
<a href="manual-core.html">Valgrind's core</a> and for the tool you want to
use.</p>
