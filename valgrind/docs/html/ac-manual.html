<p>Addrcheck is a simplified version of the Memcheck tool
described in Section 3.  It is identical in every way to
Memcheck, except for one important detail: it does not do the
undefined-value checks that Memcheck does.  This means Addrcheck
is about twice as fast as Memcheck, and uses less memory.
Addrcheck can detect the following errors:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost
    forever</p></li>
<li><p>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []</p></li>
<li><p>Overlapping <tt class="computeroutput">src</tt> and
    <tt class="computeroutput">dst</tt> pointers in
    <tt class="computeroutput">memcpy()</tt> and related
    functions</p></li>
<li><p>Some misuses of the POSIX pthreads API</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Rather than duplicate much of the Memcheck docs here
(a.k.a. since I am a lazy b'stard), users of Addrcheck are
advised to read <a href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.bugs">Kinds of bugs that Memcheck can find</a>.  Some important
points:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Addrcheck is exactly like Memcheck, except that all the
    value-definedness tracking machinery has been removed.
    Therefore, the Memcheck documentation which discusses
    definedess ("V-bits") is irrelevant.  The stuff on
    addressibility ("A-bits") is still relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Addrcheck accepts the same command-line flags as
    Memcheck, with the exception of ... (to be filled in).</p></li>
<li>
<p>Like Memcheck, Addrcheck will do memory leak checking
    (internally, the same code does leak checking for both
    tools).  The only difference is how the two tools decide
    which memory locations to consider when searching for
    pointers to blocks.  Memcheck will only consider 4-byte
    aligned locations which are validly addressible and which
    hold defined values.  Addrcheck does not track definedness
    and so cannot apply the last, "defined value",
    criteria.</p>
<p>The result is that Addrcheck's leak checker may
    "discover" pointers to blocks that Memcheck would not.  So it
    is possible that Memcheck could (correctly) conclude that a
    block is leaked, yet Addrcheck would not conclude
    that.</p>
<p>Whether or not this has any effect in practice is
    unknown.  I suspect not, but that is mere speculation at this
    stage.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Addrcheck is, therefore, a fine-grained address checker.
All it really does is check each memory reference to say whether
or not that location may validly be addressed.  Addrcheck has a
memory overhead of one bit per byte of used address space.  In
contrast, Memcheck has an overhead of nine bits per byte.</p>
<p>Due to lazyness on the part of the implementor (Julian),
error messages from Addrcheck do not distinguish reads from
writes.  So it will say, for example, "Invalid memory access of
size 4", whereas Memcheck would have said whether the access is a
read or a write.  This could easily be remedied, if anyone is
particularly bothered.</p>
<p>Addrcheck is quite pleasant to use.  It's faster than
Memcheck, and the lack of valid-value checks has another side
effect: the errors it does report are relatively easy to track
down, compared to the tedious and often confusing search
sometimes needed to find the cause of uninitialised-value errors
reported by Memcheck.</p>
<p>Because it is faster and lighter than Memcheck, our hope is
that Addrcheck is more suitable for less-intrusive, larger scale
testing than is viable with Memcheck.  As of mid-November 2002,
we have experimented with running the KDE-3.1 desktop on
Addrcheck (the entire process tree, starting from
<tt class="computeroutput">startkde</tt>).  Running on a 512MB,
1.7 GHz P4, the result is nearly usable.  The ultimate aim is
that is fast and unintrusive enough that (eg) KDE sessions may be
unintrusively monitored for addressing errors whilst people do
real work with their KDE desktop.</p>
<p>Addrcheck is a new experiment in the Valgrind world.  We'd
be interested to hear your feedback on it.</p>
