0. Concatenated file for output
  -b command line argument option works for the substitute frame buffer
     sequence, but there is no equivalent for output.

[the big picture format, -g,  will be eliminated in the release edition.  
 It's not very useful for the outside world.]

 1. Test bitstream
    Small example bitstream (128x128 pixel dimensions) which employs all 
    picture_structure (top field, bottom field, frame), picture_coding_type 
    (I, P, and B), macroblock_type (forwards/backwards/interpolated, 
    intra/non-intra, coded/not-coded, quant/no quant, etc.), and 
    motion_type (field, frame, 16X8, dual prime) modes.

 3. Incorrect coefficient in convmat[]
    correct entry in conversion matrix.
    [have not been able to identify it yet]

 4. 24 bit X11 display
    (borrow from Berkeley or find way for our code to use their interface)

 5. MPEG-2 Transport layer systems streams parsing 

 6. Document IPR issue 

   provide CableLabs URL
   how IPR relates to our disclaimer.

 7. TIFF library support (YCbCr 4:4:4, 4:2:2, and 4:2:0 pictures)
[deferred]
  
 8. Copyright extension header 
  [done]


 9. slice_id corridgendum
  [done]


10.  IDCT rounding
  As per IDCT corridgendum (Savatier, MPEG 95/XXX)
  [done, but verified ?]


11. IEEE 1180 report 
  Provide example report of the fast IDCT and source code.
  [this was done by Stefan a long time ago]
  [done]

12. green dots in can
  [ appears to be a display issue, probably related to convmat[] 
    error ]

13  detailed comments

  - implementation-specifc
  - link to ISO/IEC 13818-2

[done]

15. structural changes to getpic()
[done]

16. frame output based on repeat_first_field and top_field_first
[not terribly useful unless it is a static padding]

17. recognize 4:2:2 profile 
[done]

18. improved Options_Processing()
[done]

19. move Dual_Prime calculation into picture_data()

20. motion vector calculation to include tappable stages to test
    whether elements fall within [low:high] range.

21. Integrate verifier routines 

22. Inter-layer verification routines
    - check base and enhancement layers (e.g. SNR)

23. Spatial verification
   - considering that no base layer is available.

24. SNR verification

25. DP verification

26. merge all global bitsteam element variables into 
    common data structure (similar to layer_data).  This is needed
    for the verifier (whether or not headers in SNR and DP streams
    are identical where needed to that of the base layer).

27. investigate why MS-DOS wants an extra % sign for filename patterns
     when more than one filename pattern is used in the command line argument

28. convert -t (trace) flag into levels, merge with Verbose.

29. seek to a specified frame number (support for MCI-like functions)

30. document the "flash" VLC table decoding method in detail. 
    (namely how to map tables in Annex B to those in getvlc.h)

31. MPEG-2 program stream compatibility
   (a few minor bits of difference).
