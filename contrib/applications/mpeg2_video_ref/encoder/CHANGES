CHANGES to mpeg2encode
Updated:  July 12, 1995

Verify few changes have been made between the July 4, 1994 edition
of mpeg2encode and the July 15, 1995 edition:

BUG CORRECTIONS:

 - Based on feedback from Stephan Dancer and Peter Loje Hansen,
   corrected typo in motion.c where field_estimate() for backwards
   search was called using the forward motion vector search range.
   Likewise, another typo is putseq() was corrected where a local copy 
   of vertical search range was created from the horizontal search
   range.

 - Based on feedback by Michael Schuster, prevented calcSNR1 from
   generating 'e' with value '0' since it will be used in the 
   denominator of a division operation later.
