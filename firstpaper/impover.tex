\section{The Implementation of Embla}


Embla is based on instrumented execution of binary code. Although
our examples of profiling output use a high level language (C),
the profiling itself is on instruction level, followed by 
mapping the information to source level using debugging information 
in the standard way.

Embla uses the Valgrind instrumentation infrastructure, so there
is no offline code rewriting; the Embla tool behaves like an emulator
of the hardware.
