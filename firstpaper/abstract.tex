With the widespread use of chip multithreaded (CMT) processors, there
is an urgent need for tools and methodologies supporting
parallelization of existing applications. Writing explicitly threaded
code is a challenging task, especially since such code is naturally
nondeterministic.

In this paper we present a novel tool supporting the process of
parallelizing programs by hand. The tool, Embla, allows the user to
profile the dependencies in a sequential program, thus finding
opportunities for parallelization. While most tools for this problem
rely on static analysis, Embla is a profiler that records dependencies
as they arise during program execution. It is thus exact in contrast
to static tool which by necessity make conservative
approximation. Also, since the tool deals with the machine code of the
program, it is completely language independent.
