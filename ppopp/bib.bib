  abstract =     {Multithreaded programming is difficult and error
                  prone. It is easy to make a mistake in
                  synchronization that produces a data race, yet it
                  can be extremely hard to locate this mistake during
                  debugging. This article describes a new tool, called
                  Eraser, for dynamically detecting data races in
                  lock-based multithreaded programs. Eraser uses
                  binary rewriting techniques to monitor every
                  shared-monory reference and verify that consistent
                  locking behavior is observed. We present several
                  case studies, including undergraduate coursework and
                  a multithreaded Web search engine, that demonstrate
                  the effectiveness of this approach.},
